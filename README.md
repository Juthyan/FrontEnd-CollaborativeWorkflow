## ðŸš€ Overview

This repository hosts the **frontend monorepo** for the Collaborative Workflow platform.  
It currently contains two Nuxt 4 applications:

- **Host app** â€” main web interface (coming soon)
- **Kanban app** â€” task board and drag-and-drop interface

This frontend will connect to the **Symfony REST API MVP**, which provides the backend foundation.
